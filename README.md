# Kubernetes on Hypriot

Build a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) ([k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s)) cluster with RPis and utilize [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) for managing cluster state.

## Pre-reqs:

* This was done using a cluster of 4 x RPi 4 4GB
* All Pi's are connected via a local ethernet switch on a 10.0.0.0/24 LAN
* The master node connects to the outside world on WiFi, and provides NAT for the the rest of the cluster.
